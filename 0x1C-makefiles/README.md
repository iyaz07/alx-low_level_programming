Purpose of this repo is to learn the use of make utility and makefiles.
Make reads its instruction from Makefile (called the descriptor file) by
default.
 Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program
need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them.
 Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other
complex tasks with dependencies.
